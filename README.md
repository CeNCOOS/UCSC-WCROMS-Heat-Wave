# UCSC-WCROMS-Heat-Wave
This is code to use the hobday heatwave criteria as implemented by Eric. C. J. Oliver using a 31 year ROMS climatology with WCOFS model output.
The idea is to use the WCOFS ocean model to create a 3-day forecast of heatwave conditions off the US West Coast.  This particular code uses the SST data.
